# Eat-Da-Burger-

For this assingment I was tasked with creating a web application that would allow the user to add burgers to a database which would be rendered on their screen. There are two categories, "ready" on the left, and "devoured" on the right. The user is able to add burgers to the "ready" list where they are displayed and added to the database. A "devour" button will appear allowing the user to swap the burger item to the "devoured" list affecting both the item on the screen and in the database.\\

The application requires express, epxress-handlebars, and mysql.\\

To get started, type: "npm install" and the program will install necessary npm dependencies.
